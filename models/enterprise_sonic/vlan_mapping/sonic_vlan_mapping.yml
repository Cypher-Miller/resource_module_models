  short_description: Configure vlan mappings on SONiC.
  description:
    - This module provides configuration management for vlan mappings on devices running SONiC.
    - Vlan mappings only available on TD3 and TD4 devices.
    - For TD4 devices must enable vlan mapping first (can enable in config-switch-resource).

    config:
      description:
        - Specifies the vlan mapping related configurations.

                - Configure customer VLAN IDs.
                - If mode is double tagged translation then this VLAN ID represents the outer VLAN ID.
                - If mode is set to stacking can pass ranges and/or multiple list entries.
                - Individual VLAN ID or (-) separated range of VLAN IDs.

    state:
      description:
        - Specifies the operation to be performed on the vlan mappings configured on the device.
        - In case of merged, the input configuration will be merged with the existing vlan mappings on the device.
        - In case of deleted, the existing vlan mapping configuration will be removed from the device.
        - In case of overridden, all existing vlan mappings will be deleted and the specified input configuration will be add.
        - In case of replaced, the existing vlan mappings on the device will be replaced by the configuration for each vlan mapping.
